## 📊 Performance Results

Based on model evaluation on research datasets:

| Disorder | Accuracy | AUC Score |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Depression | 78.2% | 0.84 |
| Anxiety | 75.6% | 0.81 |
| PTSD | 72.3% | 0.79 |
| Cognitive Decline | 80.1% | 0.86 |

*Note: These are research-based accuracy metrics from model evaluation. Real-world performance may vary and should be validated in clinical settings.*

   python start.py
   ```

5. **Access the interface:**
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## 📖 Usage

### Recording Audio
1. Click the microphone button to start recording
2. Speak for 30-60 seconds (optimal analysis window)
3. Click stop when finished
4. Review the recording and click "Analyze Audio"

### Uploading Files
